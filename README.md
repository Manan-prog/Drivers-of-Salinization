# Drivers-of-Salinization
This repository contains a collection of scripts written in Python (via Google Colab) and JavaScript (on Google Earth Engine) for processing and analyzing environmental data.

The project is centered around two main tasks:

1) Extracting environmental and topographical variables from multiple data sources.

2) Developing a Random Forest Regressor model to integrate these variables and evaluate their individual contributions in explaining changes in NDVI across salinized farmlands.
